LLMs for Requirements Engineering â€“ Metro Ticket Distributor System
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project applies Generative AI to automate and enhance Requirements Engineering for a metro ticket distributor system.
Using multiple LLMs (LLaMA 3.2, Mistral, Gemini, Deepseek) integrated via Ollama and APIs, we designed a pipeline to:

Gather requirements from stakeholders
Generate user stories adhering to the INVEST framework
Prioritize requirements using the MoSCoW method
Resolve conflicts between functional and non-functional requirements
Evaluate model outputs using the RUST Questionnaire
ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Automate user story generation using multiple LLMs.
Compare outputs from different LLMs for readability, understandability, specificity, and technical accuracy.
Demonstrate how AI can assist in elicitation techniques and requirements prioritization.
Identify model limitations in acceptance criteria and stakeholder analysis.
